                    <p class="txt"><b>Dwayne Douglas Johnson</b> (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name <b>The Rock</b>, is an American actor, producer, and semi-retired professional wrestler.
            
                        Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, where he won a national championship on the 1991 Miami Hurricanes team. After being cut from the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL two months into the 1995 season, he began training for a career in professional wrestling, following in the footsteps of various family members, including his grandfather Peter Maivia and his father, Rocky Johnson, from whom he inherited Canadian citizenship in 2009.
                        
                        Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Johnson gained mainstream fame in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) from 1996 to 2004 and was promoted as the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history. He returned to WWE part-time from 2011 to 2013 and continues to make occasional appearances on the program. He is an eight time WWF/WWE Champion, two time WCW/World Champion, two time WWF Intercontinental Champion and a five time WWF Tag Team Champion. He is the sixth Triple Crown Champion in WWE and won the 2000 Royal Rumble. His autobiography The Rock Says... debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2000.
                        
                        Johnson's first leading film role was in The Scorpion King in 2002. For this, he was paid $5.5 million, a world record for an actor in his first starring role. One of his more prominent recurring roles is Luke Hobbs in The Fast and the Furious franchise. He hosted and produced The Hero, a reality competition series and has since continued to produce TV shows and films through his production company Seven Bucks Productions. In 2013, Forbes listed Johnson No. 25 in the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities and he has been in the top twenty every year since. He was the world's highest-paid actor of 2016. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. In 2015, Muscle & Fitness named him "Man of the Century".</p>

                    <p class="txt">Like his father and grandfather, several of Johnson's other (non-blood) relatives are or were professional wrestlers, including his uncles, Afa and Sika Anoaʻi (The Wild Samoans) and his cousins, Rodney (Yokozuna), Solofa (Rikishi), Matt (Rosey) and Eddie (Umaga). When Johnson declared his intent to become a wrestler, his father initially resisted, but then agreed to train him himself, warning that he would not go easy on him. Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson got Johnson several tryout matches with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. Under his real name, he defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show and lost the other matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart. After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association as Flex Kavana and winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship twice with Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson signed a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.[6]</p>
